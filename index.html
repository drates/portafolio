  <h2>A people-centred design philosophy and methodology</h2>

  <p> A weak design process is the best recipe for a failing product and investment. Thus, I take design practices very seriously. <b> People (and teams), emotions, learning and simplicity are at the center of my design thinking </b> and help me to define problems, opportunities, the multiple possible pathways for a solution and to distinguish which options are the most valuable. Likewise, these principles guide my <b>systemic, methodological approach to design through problem-solving, rapid prototyping, user-testing and iteration</b>. This guarantees that what is designed is fit for purpose and that investments generate the expected outcomes.</p>

  </br>
  <p> With thousands of specializations and advanced skills in today’s industries, the talent recruitment market has experienced significant importance and growth in the early 21st century. I co-founded and worked as Product Chief in Verital, an early stage (preseed) startup focused on an innovative platform for recruitment of professionals with verified skills.

    <div class="jumbotron">
  <h2>Work done</h2>      
  </br>
  <p> As Product Chief and Co-Founder my work involved everything about leading the strategy and design of Verital’s business model, MVP prototype and roadmap. This allowed it to go from an innovative business idea to a high-level, detailed 5-year-long business plan and advanced MVP prototype and roadmap based on comprehensive market and user research and competitor analysis that could be used for the launch of the product and shown to potential partners and investors. 
   In particular, the MVP prototype included advanced and reliable solutions to verify and validate the skills of professionals and for companies to find and recruit the specialists they need to develop their projects and business impact. The business model generated and the resulting financial projections enabled us to create a market-ready investment plan, exceeding the standard criteria required by venture capital firms for pre seed startups.</p>.

  <h3>UX design research to support the improvement of an innovative, omnichannel loyalty-as-a-service benefit program of Bci, a banking corporation with $100B assets and 5 million customers </h3>
  </div>

      <div class="jumbotron">
  <h2>Context</h2>      
  </br>
  <p> "BciPlus+" is a new loyalty program for Bci, a top banking corporation in Chile with $100B USD in financial assets and more than 5 million customers. BciPlus+ offers cashback-based benefits to its Bci customer base thanks to affiliate marketing to B2C companies through an innovative Loyalty-as-a-Service (LaaS) business model.
The BciPlus+ platform was aimed to be accessible through multiple channels, but it was behind schedule, with low traction and customer satisfaction. In other words, a key strategic investment for this large organisation was facing serious business and product challenges. In this scenario, I was especifically brought in as a Senior UX Researcher to help the teams learn how to improve the design and product, working with the agency BBK+2Brains (Chile).
</p>
  </div>

    <div class="jumbotron">
  <h2>Work done</h2>      
  </br>
  <p> Overall, my work helped BciPlus+ to efficiently understand and be on top of the critical pain points of users, as well as opportunities for improvements and innovation.
In particular, my main contribution was to help teams to achieve a profound understanding of the most important pain point for customers of BciPlus+. When I arrived, an important number of users did not receive timely confirmation of the cashback they earned after making a purchase. This not infrequent issue caused uncertainty, negative feelings, and damaged trust in BciPlus+ program as well as general Bci brand.
I used a variety of research methods, including surveys, logs from customer service, and user testing, to identify this pain point and its impact on users. Through systematic communication and presentacion skills this deep understanding of the product experience and critical pain points was developed by teams who where able to prioritize and implement sophisticated solutions.

      <p><i>Images: The home, store and benefit acquisition of BciPlus+. BciPlus+ shows users a number of cashback benefits for different associated brands in the home screen. When clicking in a store, the user is presented with the details of the offer and a button to be redirected to the store's own ecommerce website. When the users buys a product in the external ecommerce site, they do not see any visual confirmation that the cashback offered is being considered or registered. Only after completing the payment users receive a notification - yet, due to technical challenges, a significant number of users could wait more than a couple of days to be able to confirm that the cashback offered was registered by the platform. In those cases, the program was creating an important amount of uncertainity and anxiety to users which could last several hours or days, leading to very unsatisfactory experiences and damaging the trust, reputation and brand of Bci. By creating a strong-evidence based understanding of this problem and associated impacts the team was able to prioritize sophisticated solutions that changed the experience, degree of the brand-promise response fullfilment and growth potential of BciPlus+. </i></p>

    <div class="jumbotron">
  <h2>Impact & Learning</h2>      
  </br>
  <p> Following this diagnosis of critical pain points for BciPlus+, the team was able to solve the technical barriers and managed to display the obtained cashback and notify customers within a couple of minutes after buying in the associated e-commerce site.
This effort required several sprints to be completed, but it changed the face and experience of BciPlus+ from an unreliable and stressful product to a trustable and beneficial platform. SNEx metrics quickly rose 6-7 percent to a weekly average over 80%, and serious falls in satisfaction (SNEX> 70%) diminished dramatically in frequency.
This allowed the platform to sustain a continued growth of users, transactions and marketing campaigns, and a successful official launch to Bci’s customers in the next couple of months.
Overall, my work played a key role in shaping BciPlus+ from a struggling and risky bet to a reliable product and experience that can scale-up and be used by millions of users and support the large investment of Bci’s digital ecosystem.

  <h2><b> Using data to improve the Student Experience: A Design Research study of an analytics app for Scottish universities </b></h2>
  <h3>An advanced PhD study at the University of Edinburgh exploring the potential impacts of data analytics applied to the enhancement of higher education quality</h3>
  </div>

      <div class="jumbotron">
  <h2>Context</h2>      
  </br>
  <p> Higher education is a critical part of local, national, and international economies, culture, and development in the 21st century. Consequently, the quality of higher education is a paramount problem for countries and contemporary society around the globe. However, the use of data to improve higher education is still a big challenge for most universities.
In this context, I was funded with an Advanced Human Capital (Chile) scholarship to develop an innovative PhD study around the use of data to improve the student experience in the University of Edinburgh, one of the top 20 and most influential higher education institutions in the world.
I first conducted an initial rapid design ethnography with participants from multiple Scottish universities. Then, I designed, remotely tested, and iterated an app prototype. Finally, I analyzed data from contextual interviews with senior student representatives and academics, and identified several potential benefits and problems of using similar data-technologies to manage the student experience in contemporary higher education. The results suggest significant implications that should be considered in the use of data to improve the student experience in higher education.

  <p> This study was approved with minor corrections and appraised by the committee that assessed the PhD dissertation, which included Professor Dr Allison Littlejohn, the head of the Knowledge Lab at the University College of London (UCL), and Professor Dr Catherine Bovill, an international leader in student-staff partnership research and leader in academic development at the University of Edinburgh.
The study offers novel pathways for understanding how student experience data can influence the future of higher education and societies. Likewise, this study also offers directions for important future research related to teaching, learning, data analytics, user-centred design, and quality improvement and policies in higher education.
The project also contributes with likely the first tailored user-research analytics tool concept, as well as novel theorisation about design, design research methods, and user experience.
Overall, this successful, high-quality work has the potential to influence the future of higher education, educational technology, and analytics, plus user experience and design ideas and practices in universities and beyond.

  <h2><b> Informing the future of the central makerspace of the University of Edinburgh </b></h2>
  <h3> Evaluating and sharing recommendations for the innovative services and strategy of Edinburgh University's main makerspace</h3>
  </div>

      <div class="jumbotron">
  <h2>Context</h2>      
  </br>
  <p> The University of Edinburgh is one of the top and most influential higher education and research institutions in the world. The Main Library of the university created an open makerspace (uCreate Studio) for all students and staff, where they could use top-of-the-line 3D scanning and printing, CNC milling, electronics kits, resources, and expert training and advice. Makerspaces are multiplying across universities and are becoming central hubs for innovation, entrepreneurship, and research. Edinburgh University was aiming to create a place for its 40,000+ members of its community that could nurture all of these things. However, uCreate Studio still needed to be evaluated to determine its impact on the university community and inform budget decisions.
</p>
  </div>

    <div class="jumbotron">
  <h2>Work done</h2>      
  </br>
  <p> I worked for uCreate Studio as a part-time service evaluator. My mission was to analyze the impact of the makerspace and share recommendations for improvement. I collected and analyzed data from online forms and interviews, identified the most used kit, and made service blueprints for the main services offered by the makerspace. I also identified the full service funnel from potential users' awareness of the makerspace to users' training, project creation, and tracking. Additionally, I created multiple recommendations and made a summary report that helped the university and library leadership to inform a vision for the future of the makerspace and short-term investment decisions.

Obtaining these testimonies from the makerspace' users ensured that the university community could better understand the richness and depth of the implications of creating and sustaining this space, which resulted in increased investment and institutional support for the future of this project.</i></p>
      
  </div>

    <div class="jumbotron">
  <h2>Impact & Learning</h2>      
  </br>
  <p> The insights and recommendations shared were instrumental in helping the makerspace leadership make significant improvements and multiplied their investment in the most-used 3D printers and addressed the biggest bottleneck identified in my report. Furthermore,the report helped the university to understand the impact of the studio and its huge potential towards the institution's commitment to be a global leader of research and innovation. This put the university in a global advantageous position in terms of promoting mass and multidisciplinary use of makerspaces and collaborative creation and entrepreneurship.

I also identified improvements for all services offered by the makerspace, including online registration, basic training, advanced training, as well as project and impact tracking. This allowed the studio to be prepared for full-service deployment and scale-up to dozens of thousands of potential users.

In my opinion, the biggest impact of my work was to be able to show the university evidence of the significant and complex impact that the makerspace was offering to its users and the potential it could offer to the future of the institution as a place of experimentation and creativity. From demonstrating the vital impact of the studio for users creating augmented-robotics, video games, new forms of art and expression, and global-leading research, the university leaders were able to learn about what this important investment was achieving and capable of achieving for its mission as a critical hub to influence the world.

This report made an important impact for this institution of around 500 years old. It was acknowledged with the Times Higher Education Award to the best Library team in the United Kingdom, which highlighted the quality and innovation of the services provided by uCreate Studio.

  <h2>Branding</h2>      
  </br>
  <p> <b>Company personality </b> - An identity based on <i>the innocent</i>, <i> the creator</i> and <i> the leader </i> personality archetypes is proposed. These strongly align with the aspiration of transparency, innovation and becoming a reference for the industry - hence, allowing younger generations to identify with a bank brand, something which they cannot do now. </br> </br>

<b>Color palette </b> - <i>Capri</i> is a deep sky blue which represents calmness, honesty, and trust. <i>Navy blue</i> represents security, loyalty and leadership. <i>Turquoise blue</i>  represents enjoyment, prosperity and beauty. Their combination offers a great blend of novelty and security - two often opposite ideas. With this color mix we are ready to visually transmit the an attractive and realiable banking bandring</p>

<p>In order to embody the brand personality with a distinctly modern, eye-catching and attractive visual identity the isotype is based on a colorful, geometrical, balanced and minimalistic image composed of 3 triangles that also form the m letter ‘ M’ for metabanco. 

</br> </br>

This logo allows projecting 3D shapes as well as to be deconstructed into multiple visual elements that offer a modern, stylish and versatile visual display which can be scalable and easily adaptable - perfect for a simple yet highly aesthetic and memorable identity which attracts younger generations. </p>

  <h2>Mobile landing page</h2>      
  </br>
  <p> In order to land and convert prospective clients funnelled from an organic web search as well as social media campaigns, a critical part of the distribution channel of this digital bank would be a landing webpage tailored for mobile devices (which today represent the majority in internet traffic). 
    
    </br></br>
    
    Using responsive design principles and patterns this design can also be seamlessly navigated by desktop and laptop computers - enhancing consistency and reducing development time and costs. Finally, as part of a strategy to position the bank as an exlcusive and highly desired brand for younger generations, the landing page and its call-to-action will be focused on persuading visitors to apply to the wainting list to become a client, as business trend that some early startups now utilize. 
    
    </br></br>

  While catering for a massive segment, by using this tactic the bank could create a higher expectation in clients about joining the brand whilst also reinforcing the status of the values proposed by the bank - transparency, creativity and secutiry - and position itself as selective, making its clients - current and future - to feel specal and different to previous generations which used legacy banking.
    </br> </br>

The main elements of this landing page are a small navigation bar, a focused call to action inviting them to apply to join the bank's waiting list, a list of the benefits to reassure prospective customers of the unique value to become a custoemr, and a standard footer closing the page. This are discussed next.
</br> </br>

An intuitive <b>navigation bar </b> projecting the bank's slick brand, colors, and offering access to the site’s menu. The standard "burger" icon enables fast navigation for the digital natives which represent the target audience and prospectice customer.</p>

<div class="container">

</div>

</br>
<p>
A simple and direct <b>call to action </b> (CTA) highlights the value proposition of this new bank and channels visitors to apply for an account with optimal conversion. The focused, clutter-free design, clear and attractive message triggers atentions, underlines the unique value proposition of the brand compared to legacy banking and makes a very tempting offer to visitors. This gains their quick interest and achieves the strategic of the landing page, reducing the no small fraction of web visitors getting lost, bored and abandoning the page before considering a valuable action. </p>

</br></br>

<p>Following the call to action a <b>summary of the benefits </b> offered to the bank’s clients to respond to the questions and concerns of visitors and reinforce the robustness of the value proposition and increase conversion rate and customer base. Minimalistic graphical elements from the deconstructed isotype give aesthetic balance and help associate these benefits to the brand. The list of add-ons is followed by a repetition of the main call to action, inviting visitors who had doubts to join this new brand and banking experience. </p>

<div class="container">

</div>

</br>


<p> To conclude, a standard <b>footer</b>, that closes the content and scrolling-down of the landing page, projects the brand again and offers access to traditional pages for a bank website. Therefore, strengthening the trust and reputation of the company and the robustness of the vale proposition.</p>

Finally, an <b> interactive mid-fidelity prototype - made using Figma - </b> was made to show the basic <i>look and feel</i> and interactions of the landing page design. Whilst this not hi fidelity, final state of the design it can be used for user testing, iteration and further refinement required to arrive to a full-blown, effective, market ready and user-proofed product. </p>
