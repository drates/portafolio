  <h2>A people-centred design philosophy and methodology</h2>      
  </br>
  <p> A weak design process is the best recipe for a failing product and investment. Thus, I take design practices very seriously. <b> People (and teams), emotions, learning and simplicity are at the center of my design thinking </b> and help me to define problems, opportunities, the multiple possible pathways for a solution and to distinguish which options are the most valuable. Likewise, these principles guide my <b>systemic, methodological approach to design through problem solving, rapid-prototyping, user-testing and iteration</b>. This guarantees that what is designed is fit for purpose and investments generates the desired outcomes.</p>

  <h2>Market segment - generational change and banking</h2>      
  </br>
  <p> Younger generations have different expectations than the previous ones - <b>and this includes banking</b>. People between 40 and 25 years old today are used to digital solutions and to different service levels and company values than legacy banking. Neobanks and digital wallets have attacked local markets with different degrees of success. <b>In the coming 10 to 20 years</b> there will be <b> immense opportunities to capture </b> a sizeable <b>banking market share of milleanial and younger clients </b> as they displace older generations as the main economically productive segments.
</p>
  </div>

  <div class="jumbotron">
  <h2>Customer profile</h2>      
  </br>
  <p>  <i>Millenials and younger generations not impressed by legacy banking's brands and service</i> </br> </br> The banking profile of this segment can be described follwoing Strategizer agency's customer profile model:

</br></br>
Jobs:</br>
- Younger generations want a "place" to keep their money safe, without hidden fees and working for them and their values. 
</br></br>
Pains: </br>
- Difficulty to get a bank account (income criteria, paperwork).</br>
- Lack of transparency and hidden conditions and costs.</br>
- High interests for credits.</br>
- Negative social impacts and reputation of legacy banking practices do not fit with the values of young people.</br></br>
Gains </br>
- Peace of mind of knowing that their money and independence is kept safe. </br>
- Satisfaction to know that their money is not managed with negative banking practices. </br>
- Fair interest rates which allow them to invest in their future. </br> <p>
  </div>

    <div class="jumbotron">
  <h2>Value proposition</h2>      
  </br>
  <p> In order to respond to the jobs, pains and gains of the customer profile of the described market segment, the following value proposition is defined as follows: </br> </br>

<b><i>A new bank for a new society </i> - 100% digital, secure by design and free of small print or negative social impact. </b> </br> </br>

To support this value proposition, next is defined the brand elements that embodies this identity.

</p>
  </div>

   <div class="jumbotron">
  <h2>Branding</h2>      
  </br>
  <p> <b>Company personality </b> - An identity based on <i>the innocent</i>, <i> the creator</i> and <i> the leader </i> personality archetypes is proposed. These strongly align with the aspiration of transparency, innovation and becoming a reference for the industry - hence, allowing younger generations to identify with a bank brand, something which they cannot do now. </br> </br>

<b>Color palette </b> - <i>Capri</i> is a deep sky blue which represents calmness, honesty, and trust. <i>Navy blue</i> represents security, loyalty and leadership. <i>Turquoise blue</i>  represents enjoyment, prosperity and beauty. Their combination offers a great blend of novelty and security - two often opposite ideas. With this color mix we are ready to visually transmit the an attractive and realiable banking bandring</p>


<div class="container">
<img class="img-fluid img1" src="palette.png" alt="Color palette">
</div>

 </br>

<p> <b>Typography</b> - This brand needs a modern and leading identity among young generations. The balanced and highly aesthetic <i>Michroma</i> font is selected for the company/’s name and titles, while the <i>Exo</i> font is defined for general texts. These ensure standing out in the desired audience and match with a identity that is different to legacy banking.
</p>

  </div>

   <div class="jumbotron">
  <h2>Logo, isotype </h2>      
  </br>
  <p> The logo uses the Michroma font in lowercase, offering a slick and contemporary look to the company.</p>

    <div class="container">
<img class="img-fluid img1" src="logo.png" alt="Logo">
</div>

<p>In order to embody the brand personality with a distinctly modern, eye-catching and attractive visual identity the isotype is based on a colorful, geometrical, balanced and minimalistic image composed of 3 triangles that also form the m letter ‘ M’ for metabanco. 

</br> </br>

This logo allows projecting 3D shapes as well as to be deconstructed into multiple visual elements that offer a modern, stylish and versatile visual display which can be scalable and easily adaptable - perfect for a simple yet highly aesthetic and memorable identity which attracts younger generations. </p>

    <div class="jumbotron">
  <h2>Mobile landing page</h2>      
  </br>
  <p> In order to land and convert prospective clients funnelled from an organic web search as well as social media campaigns, a critical part of the distribution channel of this digital bank would be a landing webpage tailored for mobile devices (which today represent the majority in internet traffic). 
    
    </br></br>
    
    Using responsive design principles and patterns this design can also be seamlessly navigated by desktop and laptop computers - enhancing consistency and reducing development time and costs. Finally, as part of a strategy to position the bank as an exlcusive and highly desired brand for younger generations, the landing page and its call-to-action will be focused on persuading visitors to apply to the wainting list to become a client, as business trend that some early startups now utilize. 
    
    </br></br>

  While catering for a massive segment, by using this tactic the bank could create a higher expectation in clients about joining the brand whilst also reinforcing the status of the values proposed by the bank - transparency, creativity and secutiry - and position itself as selective, making its clients - current and future - to feel specal and different to previous generations which used legacy banking.
    </br> </br>

The main elements of this landing page are a small navigation bar, a focused call to action inviting them to apply to join the bank's waiting list, a list of the benefits to reassure prospective customers of the unique value to become a custoemr, and a standard footer closing the page. This are discussed next.
</br> </br>

An intuitive <b>navigation bar </b> projecting the bank's slick brand, colors, and offering access to the site’s menu. The standard "burger" icon enables fast navigation for the digital natives which represent the target audience and prospectice customer.</p>

<div class="container">
<img class="img-fluid img1" src="metab navbar.png" alt="Navigation bar">
</div>

</br>
<p>
A simple and direct <b>call to action </b> (CTA) highlights the value proposition of this new bank and channels visitors to apply for an account with optimal conversion. The focused, clutter-free design, clear and attractive message triggers atentions, underlines the unique value proposition of the brand compared to legacy banking and makes a very tempting offer to visitors. This gains their quick interest and achieves the strategic of the landing page, reducing the no small fraction of web visitors getting lost, bored and abandoning the page before considering a valuable action. </p>

<div class="container">
<img class="img-fluid img1" src="CTA.png" alt="Call to action"> </div>

</br></br>

<p>Following the call to action a <b>summary of the benefits </b> offered to the bank’s clients to respond to the questions and concerns of visitors and reinforce the robustness of the value proposition and increase conversion rate and customer base. Minimalistic graphical elements from the deconstructed isotype give aesthetic balance and help associate these benefits to the brand. The list of add-ons is followed by a repetition of the main call to action, inviting visitors who had doubts to join this new brand and banking experience. </p>

<div class="container">
<img class="img-fluid img1" src="beneficios.png" alt="Benefits">
</div>

</br>


<p> To conclude, a standard <b>footer</b>, that closes the content and scrolling-down of the landing page, projects the brand again and offers access to traditional pages for a bank website. Therefore, strengthening the trust and reputation of the company and the robustness of the vale proposition.</p>

</br> </br>

<p>

Finally, an <b> interactive mid-fidelity prototype - made using Figma - </b> was made to show the basic <i>look and feel</i> and interactions of the landing page design. Whilst this not hi fidelity, final state of the design it can be used for user testing, iteration and further refinement required to arrive to a full-blown, effective, market ready and user-proofed product. </p>
